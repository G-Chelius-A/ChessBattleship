# ChessBattleship
Videogame that emulates Battleship with a chessboard and pieces. This is a Java project that uses the IO, NIO, AWT and Swing packages.

This project has two classes, which are Game.java and Test.java; also, it was made using Java with Ant.

While you can read this description in English, the program and the commentaries were made in spanish, because this was originally conceived as a universitary homework.

When the program is started for the first time, you must register with an username and a password. Such information is stored on a .txt file, making it a simple version of a Log-In screen.

Even when this might sound obvious, you must enter your username and password in order to access to the game; otherwise, you will get a warning screen.

The game itself is quite simple. You have to put the row and column that you want to attack, after that, you have to wait to the computer's turn. If you attack a square that was already hit, you lose your turn.

The winner is determined by having hit all the enemy's pieces, while the score just adds information of how many pieces have you hit according to some hierarchy.

Besides all the information exposed above, enjoy the game! :)
