# ChessBattleship
Videogame that emulates Battleship with a chessboard and pieces. This is a Java project that uses the IO, NIO, AWT and Swing packages.

This project has two classes, which are Game.java and Test.java; also, it was made using Java with Ant.

While you can read this description in English, the program and the commentaries were made in spanish, because this was originally conceived as a universitary homework.

Besides all the information exposed above, enjoy the game! :)
